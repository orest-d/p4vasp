6) Run make and install:
   make local; make; make install

7) The executable should located at ~/p4vasp/bin




Starting:
--------------------------

Start with: p4v

Look at the documentation in the doc/intro/intro.html
(or /usr/lib/p4vasp/doc/intro.html, when installed),
if you need some clues how to deal with the p4v GUI.

Some people prefer command-line tools and automatic scripts
to a graphical interface. For those, there are some simple
scripts in the utils directory (/usr/lib/p4vasp/utils).
They are also a good example for the p4vasp-API.


P4vasp package embeds the odpdom library, that is available also as a separate
project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/odpdom) and a slightly modified version
of the piddle library (piddle.sourceforge.net).
Both odpdom and piddle are available under the LGPL License (see
odpdom/COPYING).

This package as well may contain other packages (in ext directory) under various open-source licenses:
fltk (www.fltk.org), sqlite (www.sqlite.org) and pysqlite (code.google.com/p/pysqlite).
These packages are provided for convenience only to make the installation easier.
